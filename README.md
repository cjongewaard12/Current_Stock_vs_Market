# Current_Stock_vs_Market

This script is pulling in the stock data for all S&P500 stocks for the past seven days then filtering the data to the Top 10 best and 10 worst performers based on total return
From there I then pull the major index data for the same period and take the Top five based on total return
Last step is to compare the Top 10 stocks versus the Top 5 indexes
